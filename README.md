# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is a client-side, single-page app made by React that can show the user's interview schedules. Users can also add, delete, and modify interview schedules as they need.

Through building this app, I practiced my skill of building front end by React, my interacting with data base and back-end server skills, and writing various types of test abilities (including Unit Test, Integration Test by Jest, and End to End Test by Cypress).
